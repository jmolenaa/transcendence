so npx is just a way of running things without having to download specific packages
we use it for running nodemon which allows us not to download nodemon itself and just have it on our system temporarily and then deleted after

So the "type": "module"; thingie should be used to tell Node that our project is module based, not base don CommonJS, which is the old way of doing things
This makes sure thing slike import work and Node doesnt complain about them

run npx depcheck to see which dependencies are unused


 <!-- while read -r word; do
        grep -qF "$word" package.json || echo "$word"
    done <<< "$ALL_DEPENDENCIES" -->


Apparently bcrypt sucks?

so API is just a way to communicate between client and server, also to have the server start some internal functions, store things etc.
So f.e. the API request something, once it gets that information it will process it a certain way. Like a name of a person and a date, then the server processes their timesheet and teels you how much they worked that day

so how would a server call its own things, ergo a tournament needs to send messages to certain players, a tournament starts a game or a message contains a start to a game
You call the functions internally I guess

Hoe to notify a player
{
"status": "success",
"message": "You have a new match!",
"showAlert": true
}
Could be done with this, or by setting up event listeners in the frontend to listen for push notifications, this is rather convoluted and will require a bunch more work

What should an API response look like
apparently an API response can be marked as cacheable or non cacheable?
Code on demand part of REST APIs?
Look up some example documentation on APIs
composite API
API gateways
rate limiting

So the URL is just the Uniform Resource Locator, it is the path to a resource
The URL is kind of the endpoint and specifies to the server what the client requires
There is a method you send, so GET just gets resource, POST posts it to the server, PUT will update it and DELETE deltes

So Rest APIs have endpoints for resources and when a client request it the server returns all the information about that resource, ex. fetch user will return all the info about the user

TODOS
fix workflows to only do something for pushing to main
setup makeifle rule to pull package.jsons form branches
merge Anna code, check if it works and merge it back to Anna, we'll prbably have to do this with Anna there
